# Introduction
Have had a break since last post, been traveling for work and been quite busy with a newborn. I am about to re-read this book which I consider fundamental to be able to see those pattern in your day to day issues and apply effective solutions.

In this post it's just the introduction and closing of the book, below you should be able to pick up the notes I have been taking from each chapter.

I recommend you to buy this book and take your time to digest all of it, it's very visual and a good place to start or refresh concepts, with curated examples and visualizations.

**Disclaimer** Those are just notes about the book, in no way they are as good as the content in the book which I recommend (again) to grab it and read it carefuly.
